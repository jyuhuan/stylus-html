### Why Stylus<sup style="font-variant: small-caps">HTML</sup>?
> **Q**: With so many existing applications for writers, why are you making Stylus<sup style="font-variant: small-caps">HTML</sup>? Sounds like you're reinventing the wheel. 

Yes, I am. But Stylus<sup style="font-variant: small-caps">HTML</sup> is a better wheel, in which

- The user can only access tags that have nothing to do with styles. This truly ensures the separation of content and formatting. The only way to adjust the formatting is through changing the style sheets. Even LaTeX does not do this (it allows macros like `vspace`). 
- There is only one type of file. There is not a separation between source files and rendered files. What you write in the text editor becomes the rendered result automatically in a browser. In contrast, a Markdown user typically writes in a `*.md` file, and renders the file into a `*.html` file by exporting it. 
- No external renderer or interpreter needed. Everything runs in the browser, as everything is written in pure JavaScript.

And yes, some succinctness is sacrificed, but that is the price we need to pay for achieving precisely the above three purposes.
